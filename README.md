# Library


## Description
    The motivation to build this project was to implement my initial understanding of objects. I utatlized objects, object constructors, and functions to bring it all together. This was my first project involving objects, the implementation could have been better along with the logic. 
    I found dynamically creating entire objects to be a hurdle, but managed to work around it.
